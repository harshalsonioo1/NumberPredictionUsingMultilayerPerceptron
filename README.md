# NumberPredictionUsingMultilayerPerceptron
Using MLP, we have dropped down the error to 1.7% from 7.6x% derrived from Logistic regression.
Second file is the test of various activation functions and their tweeks over error.
When hidden layers are reduced it also increases the error value howver computational time decreses as parameters are reduced
